Manually create a local folder and create some files in it will lead to duplicated folder creation on Google Drive


Uploading file will not create parent folders
The delete operation should be ordered
REMOTE_INSERT sequence, if parent folder doesn't exist

REMOTE_RENAME if local file not found, will not do anything (should create new file)

If remote rename folder and move to other place, local folder will be wrong
